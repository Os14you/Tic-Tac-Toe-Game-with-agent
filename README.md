# C++ Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built in modern C++ with a clean, object-oriented design. It features a challenging AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure it never loses. The game is played entirely in the console.

## Features

- Multiple Game Modes:
  - Human vs. AI: Test your skills against an unbeatable AI.
  - Human vs. Human: Play with a friend on the same machine.
  - AI vs. AI: Watch two AI players battle it out.
- Unbeatable AI: The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move in any situation.
- Clean Codebase: The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns, using modern C++ practices like smart pointers and classes for the Game, Board, and Players.
- Easy to Build: Comes with a pre-configured VS Code build task for one-click compilation.

## Project Structure

The project uses a standard and clean directory layout to keep the codebase organized:

```bash
.
├── build/              # Compiled output goes here
├── include/            # Header files (.hpp)
│   ├── Board.hpp
│   ├── Game.hpp
│   └── Player.hpp
├── src/                # Source files (.cpp)
│   ├── Board.cpp
│   ├── Game.cpp
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── Player.cpp
├── .gitignore          # Files to be ignored by Git
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
To build and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler that supports the C++17 standard (like g++).

- **g++ compiler:** Can be installed on Linux with `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or on Windows via `MinGW/MSYS2`.

### Building the Project

**With VS Code (Recommended)**
Step by step:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+B (or Cmd+Shift+B on Mac) to run the default build task.
3. The compiled executable will be created at build/game.

**Manually from the Terminal**
Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o build/game
```

## Running the Game

After building the project, you can run the game from the root directory with this command:

```bash
./build/game
```

You will be greeted with the main menu where you can select your desired game mode.
